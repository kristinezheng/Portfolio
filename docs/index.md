# Welcome!

I am a sophomore at MIT studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science (course 6-9) with a minor in Biology. Passionate about healthcare and fascinated by the mind, I am interested in biotechnology and neuroengineering. In the summer of 2021, I worked a software engineering role in a healthcare company and and am currently combining computer models with visual perception research at the MIT DiCarlo Lab!
