# Welcome!

I am a junior at MIT studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science (course 6-9) with a minor in Biomedical Engineering. Passionate about healthcare and fascinated by the mind, I am interested in biotechnology and neuroengineering. In the summer of 2022, I researched reinforcement learning and psychiatry in the Princeton Niv Lab and and am currently working in the MIT Computational Cognitive Science Group!
